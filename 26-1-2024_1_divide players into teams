POTD-#26
TASK-1-DIVIDE PLAYERS INTO TEAMS OF EQUAL SKILLS
APPROACH-
1.)Firstly sort the vector,then initialize two pointer one at beginning and another one point at last element,take a variable k in which we store the sum of first and last element.
2.)Start move bothe pointers towards each other.
3.)Then simply add the elements pointed by these two pointer and check if it is equal to k or not.
4.)If they are equal then add it to your answer.
5.)Otherwise return -1.
SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    long long dividePlayers(vector<int>& skill) {
        sort(skill.begin(),skill.end());
        long long i=0,j=skill.size()-1,ans;
        long long k=skill[i]+skill[j];
        ans=skill[i]*skill[j];
           i++;
        j--;
        while(i<=j){
         if(k==skill[i]+skill[j]){
             ans+=skill[i]*skill[j];
         }
         else
         return -1;
         i++;
         j--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
