TASK-1-COUNT PAIRS WHOSE SUM IS LESS THAN TARGET
APPROACH-
1.)Sort the given array and then create two pointers one point at starting element and another one at last element,then check if their sum is smaller than target or not.
2.)If yes,then increse your answer count by h-l(because the numbers between them also have sum less than target) and increase l by 1.
3.)Otherwise,decrese h by 1.
SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
            int l=0,h=nums.size()-1,ans=0;
            while(l<=h){
                if(nums[l]+nums[h]<target){
                       ans+=(h-l);
                       l++;
                }
                else
                h--;
            }
return ans;
        
    }
};
