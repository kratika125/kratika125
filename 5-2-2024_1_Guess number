POTD-#35
TASK-1-GUESS NUMBER
APPROACH-
1.)Set low to 1 and high to that input and then calculate mid,and then send this mid to that GUESS AI and if it return -1(means mid is greater than pick)set high to mid-1.
2.)If it return 1(means mid is lower than pick) set low to mid+1, if it return 0(it means we guess correct)then return mid.
SOLUTION-
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
