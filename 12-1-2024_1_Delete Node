TASK-1-DELETE NODE IN LINKED LIST
APPROACH-
1.)It is given in the problem that a node that is going to deleted cannot be last node.
2.)So,we store the value of node which is next to node(to be deleted)in the node(to be deleted) and then points node->next to node->next->next.
SOLUTION-
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
       node->val=node->next->val;
       node->next=node->next->next;
    }
};
TIME COMPLEXITY-
O(1)
SPACE COMPLEXITY-
O(1)
