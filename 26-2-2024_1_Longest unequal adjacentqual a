TASK-1-LONGEST UNEQUAL ADJACENT GROUPS SUBSEQUENCE
APPROACH-
1.)Simply compare group array adjacent elememnts and then put the word elements of that index(when the adjacent are different)
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> getLongestSubsequence(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& g) {
        vector<string>v;
       v.push_back(words[0]);
        for(int i=0;i<g.size()-1;i++){
            if(g[i]!=g[i+1]){
            v.push_back(words[i+1]);
            }
        }
        return v;

    }
};
