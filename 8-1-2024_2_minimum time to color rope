TASK-2-MINIMUM TIME TO MAKE ROPE COLORFUL
APPROACH-
1.)Compare two consecutive elements,if they are equal then compare there neededtime.
2.)If neededtime is larger of first element than second,then add neededtime of minimum of these two to answer and also change the value of neededtime of second element=neededtime of first element.
3.)Otherwise do same as 2nd step but not change the neededtime.
SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& n) {
        int ans=0,i=0,j;
         while(i<colors.size()-1){
             if(colors[i]==colors[i+1])
            {       if(n[i]<n[i+1])
            ans+=n[i];
            else{
            ans+=n[i+1];
            n[i+1]=n[i];
                       }
             }
          i++;
          }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
