TASK-2-LEXICOGRAPHICALLY SMALLEST PALINDROME
APPROACH (TWO POINTER APPROACH)-
1.)Simply take two pointer,first point to first element and other one points to last element and check them they are equal or not.
2.)If they are not equal then check which one character is first in dictionary then change other one character to that.
SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    string makeSmallestPalindrome(string s) {
        int i=0,j=s.size()-1;
        while(i<j){
            if(s[i]!=s[j]){
                if(s[j]>s[i])
                s[j]=s[i];
                else
                    s[i]=s[j];
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
